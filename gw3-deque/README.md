Welcome to the word deque where you can put individual words into a double ended queue for some reason.

The program gives a menu to choose from a list of options.
1: Loads a list of words in any format from a file.
2: Writes the list of words to a file with each line occupying 1 word.
3: Prints all words on screen.
4: Prints the word at the front of the queue.
5: Prints the word at the back of the queue.
6: Delete a word with the option to delete the front or back.
7: Adds a word with the option to delete the front or back.
8: Quits program.

The biggest problem I faced was deciding how to pass the deque. As it turns out, I was overcomplicating things a bit.

Other than that the deque was the smoothest implementation of a complex data structor I was able to get functioning.
